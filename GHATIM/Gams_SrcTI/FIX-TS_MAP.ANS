* FIX-TS_MAP.ANS

* TIMES GAMS code internally sets TS_MAP(REG,TS,TS) = YES for all TS,
* this is not wanted when we transform TS_MAP into TS_PARENT.

TS_MAP(REG,TS,TS) = NO;

* TIMES GAMS code internally sets TS_MAP(REG,'ANNUAL',TS) = YES for all TS,
* which can result in TS_MAP(REG,'ANNUAL',TS) = YES and also TS_MAP(REG,TS2,TS) = YES
* for TS2 <> 'ANNUAL'.  This is not wanted when we transform TS_MAP into TS_PARENT,
* it is the TS_MAP(REG,TS2,TS) = YES for TS2 <> 'ANNUAL' that we want to keep,
* so when we detect this situation we set TS_MAP(REG,'ANNUAL',TS) = NO.

*there is a loop(REG, so declare scalar countTS2 in I_MMINIT.ANS
*scalar countTS2;
loop(TS,
  countTS2 = 0;
  loop(TS2$(NOT SAMEAS(TS2,'ANNUAL') AND TS_MAP(REG,TS2,TS)),
    countTS2 = countTS2+1;
  );
  if(countTS2 > 0,
    TS_MAP(REG,'ANNUAL',TS) = NO;
  );
);
